# Simple Interest Calculator

## Installation

Clone the repository and then launch it in your favourite browser.
```
$> git clone git@github.com:lawruixi/vftvk-Simple-Interest-Calculator.git
$> cd vftvk-Simple-Interest-Calculator/
```
Alternatively, you can simply go to the Github Page [here](https://lawruixi.github.io/vftvk-Simple-Interest-Calculator/).
Afterwards, fiddle around with the fields and press Compute Interest to calculate simple interest earned.

## Hold On, Why Are There Two JavaScript Files

Oh, those. script_compound.js is for compound interest, which I accidentally programmed and was then subsequently too lazy to remove. You can change the script src in the HTML file if you want the Compound Interest calculator.
